title: How to use AAD authentication to Azure Service Bus with NServiceBus
description: In this post we look at how we can leverage Azure Active Directory authentication to Azure Service Bus with NServiceBus to free ourselves of access keys.
---

# Introduction

In an effort to improve the security of our applications, we strive to consistently use Azure Active Directory authentication to Azure services.

In doing so, we free ourselves of having to secure sensitive information:

1. AAD authentication relies on tokens the application can acquire at runtime, meaning we don't need access keys or connection strings with passwords.
1. Thanks to [Azure managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview), our applications have access to the necessary credentials when they run in Azure.

We already use AAD authentication to connect to a variety of services: Azure SQL, Azure Blobs and Queues, Azure Key Vault, and App Configuration.

We recently investigated how we could do the same to connect to Azure Service Bus.

## Current landscape

Instead of integrating directly with Azure Service Bus, we use NServiceBus, which brings a tonne of benefits:

- It is transport-agnostic, which means we can run our messaging solutions locally by targetting RabbitMQ with minimal code changes.
- Reliability and recoverability are built-in concepts, so it is extremely easy to define complex retry policies when a processing error occurs.
- NServiceBus can audit all processed messages to a centralised location for better traceability and easier troubleshooting.

This also means that we delegate the responsibility of integrating with Azure Service Bus to NServiceBus.
At the time of writing, the [Azure Service Bus transport NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Transport.AzureServiceBus/) for NServiceBus depends on an older Azure Service Bus client library, Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.

A newer library, called Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus, was released a few months back.
That library is part of the new Azure SDK, which brings a consistent way to use AAD authentication across all the client libraries thanks to Azure.Identity.
While we can't use the new library with NServiceBus right now, it's worth nothing that upgrading the Azure Service Bus transport to the new Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus library is tracked in a GitHub issue over at <https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.Transport.AzureServiceBus/issues/361>.

We still wanted to leverage AAD authentication, so we decided to perform a multi-step investigation:

1. Does Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus support AAD authentication? If it doesn't, we'll need to wait for the transport to use the new library.
1. If it does support AAD authentication, does NServiceBus expose the necessary extensilibity points for us to use it?
1. Finally, can we leverage Azure.Identity with an older library that's not part of the new Azure SDK?

Let us perform some detective work.

## The investigation

### Part one

We first want to find out whether the Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus library supports AAD authentication.

Unfortunately, it wasn't as easy as we expected to find out.
After some spelunking through the samples looking for specific keywords like AAD, token, or managed identity, we found the [following sample on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-msi-servicebus-dotnet/blob/03be4e05b5803e464d416b66fd729d23bd4220fb/WebAppServiceBus/WebAppServiceBus/Controllers/HomeController.cs#L62-L65):

```csharp
var tokenProvider = TokenProvider.CreateManagedServiceIdentityTokenProvider();
QueueClient sendClient = new QueueClient($"sb://{Config.Namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/", Config.Queue, tokenProvider);
await sendClient.SendAsync(new Message(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(messageInfo.MessageToSend)));
await sendClient.CloseAsync();
```

Great news!
We can see in this sample that the connection string doesn't contain any access keys, and we use a token provider instead, which we suspect the client library uses internally to acquire a token.

Looking into it a bit further, there is an [`ITokenProvider` abstraction](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus_5.1.3/sdk/servicebus/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus/src/Primitives/ITokenProvider.cs) with 3 built-in implementations:

1. The first one is [`SharedAccessSignatureTokenProvider`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus_5.1.3/sdk/servicebus/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus/src/Primitives/SharedAccessSignatureTokenProvider.cs), which generates tokens from a shared access key &mdash; this is what we want to stay away from.
1. The second one is [`AzureActiveDirectoryTokenProvider`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus_5.1.3/sdk/servicebus/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus/src/Primitives/AzureActiveDirectoryTokenProvider.cs) where the consumer has full control over the token acquisition process by passing in a delegate.
1. Finally, the last one is [`ManagedIdentityTokenProvider`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus_5.1.3/sdk/servicebus/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus/src/Primitives/ManagedIdentityTokenProvider.cs), which uses the Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication library to acquire a token.

We'll get back to this, but for now, let's see if NServiceBus exposes a way for us to provide a token provider.

### Part two

We're now focussing on the Azure Service Bus transport for NServiceBus.

Much easier this time, as [the documentation page](https://docs.particular.net/transports/azure-service-bus/configuration#connectivity) listing all configuration options for this transport has a "Connectivity" section, indicating that a token provider can be provided.

Two for two for now, let's keep going!

### Part three

As a reminder, what we're evaluating here is whether we can use Azure.Identity with the Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus library, which doesn't support it natively.

❓ _Why is this important since we found a token provider that can leverage Azure managed identities already_ ❓

That's a good question;
when we think about it, we could use the built-in token provider.
However, there's two reasons we want to use Azure.Identity:

1. The main one is that Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication is no longer recommended to use, and Azure.Identity should be used for all new development &mdash; see the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/service-to-service-authentication).
1. The second one is that most our integrations using AAD authentication use Azure.Identity, so it makes sense for us to keep a single ubiquitous library to perform token acquisition.

This wasn't complicated since the built-in [`ManagedIdentityTokenProvider`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/servicebus/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus/src/Primitives/ManagedIdentityTokenProvider.cs) gives us a great starting point.
In fact, our implementation is very similar, only swapping one library for another.

```csharp
internal class AzureIdentityTokenProvider : TokenProvider
{
    private static readonly string[] _azureServiceBusScopes = new[] { "https://servicebus.azure.net//.default" };

    private readonly TokenCredential _tokenCredential;

    public AzureIdentityTokenProvider(TokenCredential tokenCredential)
    {
        _tokenCredential = tokenCredential;
    }

    public override async Task<SecurityToken> GetTokenAsync(string appliesTo, TimeSpan timeout)
    {
        var requestContext = new TokenRequestContext(_azureServiceBusScopes);
        var tokenResponse = await _tokenCredential.GetTokenAsync(requestContext, default);

        return new JsonSecurityToken(
            tokenResponse.Token,
            appliesTo);
    }
}
```

We tested this and confirmed that it's working as expected.

## Putting it all together

Now that we have all the information, here's a sample showing how to leverage AAD authentication to Azure Service Bus with NServiceBus:

```csharp
var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .UseNServiceBus(context =>
    {
        var endpointConfiguration = new EndpointConfiguration("<endpoint-name>");
        
        //
        // DefaultAzureCredential can be used when running the solution locally
        // as it will get a token using the account logged in developer tools
        // like Visual Studio, VS Code, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell.
        //
        // ManagedIdentityCredential is used when running in Azure as it's what
        // we want to use to acquire a token.
        //
        var credential = context.HostingEnvironment.IsDevelopment()
            ? new DefaultAzureCredential(includeInteractiveCredentials: false)
            : new ManagedIdentityCredential();

        var transport = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport<AzureServiceBusTransport>();
        transport.ConnectionString("Endpoint=sb://<service-bus-namespace>.servicebus.windows.net/");
        transport.CustomTokenProvider(new AzureIdentityTokenProvider(credential));

        // Rest of the endpoint configuration

        return endpointConfiguration;
    })
    .ConfigureServices(services =>
    {
        // Registrations omitted for brevity
    })
    .Build();

host.Run();
```

## Conclusion

We first went through the benefits of using AAD authentication within our applications, as it allows us to remove access keys and passwords from our configuration.

We then had a look at the current state of the Azure Service Bus transport for NServiceBus, and how it's using an older library that might not support AAD authentication.

Followed an investigation piece where we confirmed three things:

1. Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus supports AAD authentication.
1. We can leverage that capability when using NServiceBus.
1. We implemented an authentication provider based on Azure.Identity.

Finally, we saw in a sample how we could put all the pieces of the puzzle together.
