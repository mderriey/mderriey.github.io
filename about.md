> I'm a French software developer living in Luxembourg and working with MakerX.

I left France in 2015 to join the amazing team at Readify (now Telstra Purple) in Sydney, Australia.
After 3+ years of consulting, I joined the internal IT team where I learned about PowerShell, systems administration and automation, and user support.
I then pivoted back to software development, and I spent 18 months as a Technical Lead where my team was in charge of the internal applications used by the business.

In 2021, I joined [Prospa](https://www.prospa.com/), a company specialised in loans to small businesses.
There, I helped create .NET project templates to make bootstrapping new projects easier and consistent.
I also liaised with the Platform team to create reusable build and deployment pipelines with a balance between technical and security requirements from the Platform team, and ease of use for the various development teams.

At the end of 2021, my partner and I decided to move back to France and take a break from work to reconnect with friends and families.

After a year-long break (time fliiiies), I joined [MakerX](https://makerx.com.au) at the end of 2022.
At the time of writing this, it hasn't been long, but it's been extremely fun so far.
